                <p>I am a PhD candidate in Accounting at the University in Mannheim. I did a research visit at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. I hold a M.Sc. of the University of Mannheim and Bocconi University in Accounting, Financial Management and Control.<br> <br>
                My research explores the real effects of information disclosure, with a particular focus on environmental information and its impact on firm behavior and capital markets. I am especially interested in how decision making under uncertainty and managerial learning shape responses to disclosure and transparency expectations. To address these questions, I use a combination of archival and (survey) experimental methods.</p>
